      <h2> Challenges </h2>
      <p>  Developing the combat commands for Steet Fighter was a challange to overcome. Some of the inputs did not function properly. 
        The physics of the game overall with the player being able to punch and kick was a struggle to establish. I subsituted the two player aspect of the game. 
        Now the user will be able to play against the AI. This is an ongoing chllange that im still working on mastering.   </p>

        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>   The UI of the main menu has been revamped. It is no longer a multiplayer game. Its now a solo player in which you play against the AI. The sound effects are implemeented
            along with an arcade style type of music. The commands in the options are fully functionable. You are able to pause the game with command and are able to quit anytime soon.
        The game does not save your progress, however, since this game does not have a story tied to it . This should be an issue. </p>

        <p>  In StickFighters the navigation bar will be completely functionable. The health bar, The player vs the AI, combat sound effects, and a winner banner will be incorporated.
            We will continue to make adjustments to our game. For more information click the FAQ. </p>
